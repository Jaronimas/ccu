                                        ccsetdate
Program to set the date and time  of eSmart3 charge controllers to system date and time.

Instructions:

1. Start the program.

For linux use the file named ccsetdate, for Windows use ccsetdate.exe

To run ccsetdate open a terminal or console and type:

ccsetdate <commport>

commport is the name of the serial port connected to the charge controller.

Examples:

Linux: 
ccsetdate  /dev/ttyUSB0 

In linux, to use ccsetdate you must have permission to use the serial port. In most systems 
by being in group dialout, otherwise you need root privileges, use sudo. Example:

sudo ccsetdate /dev/ttyUSB0

Windows:
ccsetdate COM5

In Windows if the port number is greater than 9 add \\.\ to the name:
ccsetdate \\.\COM33

2. Program execution

2.1 When the progarm starts ,if the port is not available ccsetdate will print: 
Failed to open comm port.
and exit.

2.2 If the port is available but there is no reply from a charger ccsetdate will print:
Charge Controller not found.
and exit.

2.3 If there is a reply from a charger ccsetdate will print the charger info,
for example:

Found charger eSmart3-60A-MPPT  serial 36000000 date 20181013 version V3.0

Note that the serial number reported by the charger has 2 more zeroes 
than the serial number on the charger label.

If there is no problem it will write:

Date and time set to <system date and time>

for example: Date and time set to Sat Aug 17 13:25:49 2019

If something is wrong it will write:

Set failed
