                                        ccpars 
Program to modify the sampling parameters of eSmart3 charge controllers.

Instructions:

1. Start the program.

For linux use the file named ccpars, for Windows use ccpars.exe

To run ccpars open a terminal or console and type:

ccpars <commport>

commport is the name of the serial port connected to the charge controller.

Examples:

Linux: 
ccpars  /dev/ttyUSB0 

In linux, to use ccpars you must have permission to use the serial port. In most systems 
by being in group dialout, otherwise you need root privileges, use sudo. Example:

sudo ccpars /dev/ttyUSB0

Windows:
ccpars COM5

In Windows if the port number is greater than 9 add \\.\ to the name:
ccpars \\.\COM33

2. Program execution

2.1 When the progarm starts ,if the port is not available ccpars will print: 
Failed to open comm port.
and exit.

2.2 If the port is available but there is no reply from a charger ccpars will print:
Charge Controller not found.
and exit.

2.3 If there is a reply from a charger ccpars will print the charger info,
for example:

Found charger eSmart3-60A-MPPT  serial 36000000 date 20181013 version V3.0

Note that the serial number reported by the charger may be different from 
the serial number on the charger label.

2.3.1 The program will display this menu:

 Select Sampling Parameter to modify
 0 - Exit Program
 1-PV voltage ratio      ( 3300)     2-offset(    0) reading 0.1 
 3-Battery voltage ratio ( 1620)     4-offset(    0) reading 13.2 
 5-Charge current ratio  ( 2150)     6-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
 7-Load current ratio    ( 1100)     8-offset(  130) reading 0.0 
 9-Load voltage ratio    ( 1666)    10-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
11-Out voltage  ratio    ( 1666)    12-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
Enter a value from 0 to 12: 3

The number in parentheses next to each parameter is the current value, the number next to reading
is the corresponding voltage or current, for example, the value of Battery Voltage
above 13.2 volts, the ratio is 1620 and the offset is 0. 

2.3.2 To use the menu, enter the number of the parameter you want to change, 
the program will then request the new value, for example is 3 is selected:

Modify Battery voltage ratio  
Current value 1620  Enter new value: 1621

It will then ask for confirmation:

Change Battery voltage ratio  to 1621, confirm Y/N:y

If y or Y is entered it will proceed, otherwise it will return to the menu.

If there is no problem it will write:

Parameter Changed

If something is wrong it will write:

Modify failed

2.3.3 After the operation it will return to the menu, showing the new value:

 Select Sampling Parameter to modify
 0 - Exit Program
 1-PV voltage ratio      ( 3300)     2-offset(    0) reading 0.1 
 3-Battery voltage ratio ( 1621)     4-offset(    0) reading 13.2 
 5-Charge current ratio  ( 2150)     6-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
 7-Load current ratio    ( 1100)     8-offset(  130) reading 0.0 
 9-Load voltage ratio    ( 1666)    10-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
11-Out voltage  ratio    ( 1666)    12-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
Enter a value from 0 to 12: 

Tip: Enter any other number to refresh the reading

To exit the program enter 0.
