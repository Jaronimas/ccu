                                        ccpars 
Program to modify the sampling parameters of eSmart3 charge controllers.

Instructions:

ccpars requires one parameter: the device name of the serial port. 
Usually /dev/ttyUSB0 

To use ccpars you must have permission to use the serial port. In most systems 
by being in group dialout, otherwise you need root privileges, use sudo.
Example:

sudo ccpars /dev/ttyUSB0

If the port is not available ccpars will print: 

Failed to open comm port.

If there is no reply from a charger ccpars will print:

Charge Controller not found.

If there is a reply from a charger ccpars will print the charger info,
for example:

Found charger eSmart3-60A-MPPT  serial 36000000 date 20181013 version V3.0

Note that the serial number reported by the charger has 2 more zeroes 
than the serial number on the charger label.

The program will display this menu:

 Select Sampling Parameter to modify
 0 - Exit Program
 1-PV voltage ratio      ( 3300)     2-offset(    0) reading 0.1 
 3-Battery voltage ratio ( 1620)     4-offset(    0) reading 13.2 
 5-Charge current ratio  ( 2150)     6-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
 7-Load current ratio    ( 1100)     8-offset(  130) reading 0.0 
 9-Load voltage ratio    ( 1666)    10-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
11-Out voltage  ratio    ( 1666)    12-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
Enter a value from 0 to 12: 3

The number next to each parameter is the current value, the number next to reading
is the corresponding voltage or current, for example, the value of Battery Voltage
is 13.2 volts.

To use the menu, enter the number of the parameter you want to change, 
the program will then request the new value:

Modify Battery voltage ratio  
Current value 1620  Enter new value: 1621

It will then ask for confirmation:

Change Battery voltage ratio  to 1621, confirm Y/N:y

If y or Y is entered it will proceed, otherwise it will return to the menu/

If there is no problem it will write:

Parameter Changed

If something is wrong it will write:

Modify failed

After the operation it will return to the menu, showing the new value:

 Select Sampling Parameter to modify
 0 - Exit Program
 1-PV voltage ratio      ( 3300)     2-offset(    0) reading 0.1 
 3-Battery voltage ratio ( 1621)     4-offset(    0) reading 13.2 
 5-Charge current ratio  ( 2150)     6-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
 7-Load current ratio    ( 1100)     8-offset(  130) reading 0.0 
 9-Load voltage ratio    ( 1666)    10-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
11-Out voltage  ratio    ( 1666)    12-offset(    0) reading 0.0 
Enter a value from 0 to 12: 

To exit the program enter 0.
